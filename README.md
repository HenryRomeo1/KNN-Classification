## ðŸ¤– k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classification

**Problem Statement**:  
Classify instances into categories based on proximity to training samples using the kNN algorithm.

**Data**:  
- Source: kNN Classification Dataset (`bank`)

**Data Mining Operations**:  
- Performed normalization.
- Applied kNN classification.
- Created confusion matrix and calculated accuracy score.

**Model Outputs**:  
- Confusion matrix visualization.
- Accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

**Limitations**:  
- Sensitivity to choice of `k` and feature scaling.

**Were you able to effectively solve the problem?**  
Yes, the model achieved good accuracy, showing strong classification performance.
